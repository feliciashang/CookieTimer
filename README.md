# 🍪 Cookie Timer

**Cookie Timer** is a fun, React-based step-by-step timer app designed to help you bake cookies perfectly. Baking cookies involves several crucial steps where timing is key — chilling the dough, preheating the oven, baking, and cooling all require precise timers to get the best results. Each stage of the baking process — **Chill Dough**, **Preheat**, **Bake**, and **Cool** — has its own dedicated timer with a clear visual and a helpful popup notification when the time runs out.
